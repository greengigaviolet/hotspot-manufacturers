- What brought you to the Helium Network?
  
  We  have helium experience that we have helped merchants of Helium to help them with OEM production and we sold large quantities of products indirectly through Helium. Now, we would like to collaborate directly with Helium. After conducting in-depth research on LoRa wireless signal products, our company has kept a strong interest in the Helium network. Helium aims to provide open and extensive global wireless network coverage for IoT devices that support the LoRaWAN standard. At present, there are hundreds of thousands of gateways on the Helium block chain, and we aspire to become a hot spot manufacturer for Helium, contributing to the expansion and development of the network and providing high-quality devices to support users' connectivity needs in the Helium network.

## Hardware Security Element (required) 



- The community is concerned about devices that can be easily hacked, specifically by copying their swarm_key files. Applications should include plan for how the devices will be secured. The approved security element is an ECC608. If you would like to use an alternative security element your HIP19 will require additional review, please email the Helium Foundation ([christina@helium.foundation](mailto:christina@helium.foundation)).
  
- Are you using an ECC608. Yes or No?
  YES.
- Encrypted/locked-down firmware. Yes or No? If yes, please explain.
  No.

  No.
- Encrypted buses, potting and other anti-tampering measures. Yes or No? (Please note, the final design will be audited against this statement. Do not answer 'yes' unless the design will have these features and a description of where they are implemented can be provided. If yes, please explain.)
  No.
- Willingness to submit a prototype for audit, and sharing those audit results publicly (pass or fail) Yes or No?
  Yes, we are willing to submit samples.

## Hardware Information (required) Please provide detailed hardware designs, including relevant parts. 



Evidence of a functioning prototype - photos/videos. Renderings are OK but physical prototypes are much, much better.

- What are your plans for software setup and configuration for the devices? This would includes remote updates and the ability for hosts to change wifi settings, via Helium's official app or otherwise.
  This would include remote updates and the ability for hosts to change wifi settings, via Helium's official app or otherwise. Device settings can be configured through the backend management system of the main controller. Users can also utilize the mobile client to configure the device via Bluetooth, providing various options for customization. 
  
- Which security implementation (ECC608, TPM, TrustZone, other) are you using?
  ECC 608
  
- Which LoRa chipset are you planning to use in your gateway? (We recommend you don't use the SX1301 in new designs.)
  SX1302

## Manufacturing Information (required) 



- Have you built and delivered radio hardware products before?
  Yes, we have delivered LoRa gateway products and Wisun gateway products in Indonesia with corresponding upper computer system terminals.
- Have you built gateways before?
  We have developed a LoRaWAN gateway that has completed its hardware, software, and structural component functions. It has undergone multiple sampling and validation processes, its functionality meets the requirements, and has been sold and applied to multiple project sites. Currently, the product is being maintained and updated.
- How many gateways have you previously built?
  More than 100000 units.
- If you have not built gateways before, are you using a third party manufacturer or working with a partner? This is the single largest risk with most hardware ventures. If possible please provide information about your manufacturing partners and supply chain.
  
- Where are you sourcing your components from?
  We source our components from our cooperating suppliers, if other manufacturers launch better components, will also purchase and test them.
- How many radio modules/ concentrators can you procure?
  Currently, our company has already launched and put LoRaWAN radio modules/concentrators on sale, and we have a stock of approximately 5000+ units. After selling 5000 units, we only need to purchase chips, and we will produce modules/centralizers ourselves.

## Proof of Identity 



Per typical KYC/AML procedures, proof of identity for major shareholders (25%+ ownership) will be expected to be provided privately to representatives from the Helium Foundation. This will be attested and publicly confirmed by those representatives. Details for this will be provided after your application has been submitted on GitHub.
Please indicate how to provide the required proof or information.

## Budget & Capital (required) 



- How many Hotspots are you planning to manufacture and sell within the first six months of sales?
  We plan to sell 10000 units, of which 5000 are in stock and the other 5000 are manufactured.
- How much money will be required up-front? How much money do you have on-hand, and how much do you have access to?
  We have sufficient funds to invest in procurement in this field.
- What is your plan for additional financing if required? (This is the second biggest risk in new hardware ventures, getting almost over the line and then running out of cash.)
  At the moment, we do not have any plans for financing. We currently have a stable customer base and a healthy financial situation. The project will be operated independently.

## Risks & Challenges (required) 



Please tell us about some of the challenges that would prevent these products from becoming a reality and how you might address them. Who will develop the Hotspot onboarding and management app? Will it be an internal team or external company?

The main challenge we are currently facing is the lingering issue of chip shortages from previous years. However, through our agents, we have gained insights that the chip shortage situation has been alleviated. Overall, I believe electronic components and chip shortages are obstacles faced by most hardware manufacturers. Therefore, based on our research, we will proactively stock up on key components to avoid unnecessary issues.
